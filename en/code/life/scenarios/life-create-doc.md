Analyze the files @life.py and @test_life.py inside the `game` directory and create a documentation file doc.md based on them.

The documentation structure should be as follows:
-   **Title:** # Project "Game of Life"
-   **Brief description:** Explanation of what this project is (implementation of Conway's cellular automaton).
-   **File structure:** Brief description of the purpose of `life.py` and `test_life.py` files.
-   **How to run the simulation:** Section with the command to run the main file (`python life.py`).
-   **How to run tests:** Section with the command to run tests (`pip install pytest numpy`, and then `pytest`).
