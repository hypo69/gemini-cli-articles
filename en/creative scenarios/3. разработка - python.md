Here are 5 more useful scenarios that can be implemented with Gemini CLI, delving into its more advanced capabilities. 

### 1. **Code Analysis and Refactoring**

Gemini CLI can work with files and directories in your local file system. You can use this feature to analyze an existing codebase, find potential errors, or refactor code.

**Scenario:** You have a large Python file and want to improve its readability by adding comments and renaming variables to be more understandable.
**Command:**

```bash
gemini-cli "Analyze the file @my_python_script.py. Add comments to each function and variable. If variable names are uninformative, suggest more appropriate ones."
```

**Advantage:** Saves your time, as you don't have to manually review all the code. Gemini CLI quickly finds the right places and suggests improvements that you can accept or reject.

-----

### 2. **Unit Test Generation**

Gemini CLI can generate unit tests for your code, which helps ensure its quality and reliability. This is especially useful when working with new or complex functions.

**Scenario:** You just wrote a new JavaScript function and want to create a set of tests for it.
**Command:**

```bash
gemini-cli "Write unit tests for the `calculate_price` function in the @product_logic.js file. Tests should cover different scenarios, including edge cases."
```

**Advantage:** Automates the routine task of writing tests, allowing you to focus on the core logic of the code.

-----

### 3. **Task Automation with Scripts**

Gemini CLI can be integrated into your scripts, allowing you to automate multi-step workflows. You can pass the results of one command to another, creating powerful and flexible command chains.

**Scenario:** You need to regularly generate reports on the number of commits in a Git repository for the last week.
**Command:**

```bash
# Example script that can be saved as `generate_report.sh`
#!/bin/bash
REPORT=$(gemini-cli "Generate a report on the number of commits in this repository for the last week, using git log. The report should be in a bulleted list format.")
echo "$REPORT" > weekly_report.md
```

**Advantage:** Allows you to create custom tools for automating repetitive tasks, which increases your productivity.

-----

### 4. **Intelligent File Operations**

Gemini CLI can work with files not only for analysis, but also for performing various operations, such as changing content or creating new files.

**Scenario:** You need to move all functions from one JavaScript file to a separate file to improve modularity.
**Command:**

```bash
gemini-cli "Analyze the file @utils.js. Move each function to a separate file, naming it after the function. Remove functions from the original file and replace them with imports."
```

**Advantage:** Gemini CLI can perform complex file system operations that usually require manual work or writing your own scripts.

-----

### 5. **Working with Context and Memory**

Gemini CLI has an advanced context management system. You can save and resume sessions, and also use special commands to give Gemini additional information about the project.

**Scenario:** You are working on a large project and want to give Gemini full context about its structure so that it can answer your questions more effectively.
**Command:**

```bash
# Inside Gemini CLI session
/memory refresh
gemini-cli "Describe the architecture of this project based on the files in the current directory."
```

**Advantage:** Thanks to the `/memory` and `@` commands, Gemini can understand your entire project, even if it is very large, which allows you to get more accurate and relevant answers to complex questions.
