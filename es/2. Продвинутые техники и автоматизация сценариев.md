## Gemini CLI: Advanced Techniques and Scenario Automation.

In the first part, we covered the basics: installation, authentication, and running individual commands. Now let's move to the next level. In this part, we will teach Gemini CLI to execute complex multi-step scenarios that can be saved, reused, and shared with the team. This will transform the tool from a simple assistant into a powerful automation engine.

### Scenario Execution Mechanism

The key idea is to use `.md` files as "recipes" or "scenarios" for Gemini. Inside such a file, we describe in natural language the sequence of actions the AI should perform.

To execute a scenario, we will use the built-in `ReadFile` tool. We will simply ask Gemini to read the instruction file and execute them.

**Main command to execute any scenario:**
```
> Read and execute instructions from the file 'scenario_name.md'
```

Now, let's look at some useful scenarios.

Create a directory `scenarios`.
```bash
/path/to/gemini-cli > mkdir scenarios
```

in it we will store our scenarios.


### Scenario: "Git Repository Audit"

This task is familiar to every developer: before starting work, you need to check the current state of the project. We will create a scenario that will do this for us.

1.  **In the `scenarios` directory, create the file `git-health-check.md`** with the following content:

    ```markdown
    You are an experienced Git engineer. Your task is to perform a complete audit of the current repository.
    
    Follow the steps below strictly in order and wait for my confirmation for each command:
    
    1.  **Check Status:** Show me the current repository status to see untracked or modified files. Suggest the command `!git status`.
    2.  **Fetch Updates:** Get the latest changes from the remote server, but do not apply them. Suggest the command `!git fetch origin`.
    3.  **Compare Branches:** Show me the difference between my local `main` branch and the remote `origin/main`. Suggest the command `!git log main..origin/main --oneline`.
    4.  **Find Large Files:** Find the 5 largest files in the project that are not in `.git`. Suggest the command `!find . -type f -not -path "./.git/*" -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -rn | head -n 5`.
    5.  **Summarize:** At the end, briefly describe the repository status based on the obtained data.
    ```

2.  **Execute the scenario in Gemini CLI:**

    ```
    > Read and execute the scenario 'git-health-check.md'
    ```

In reality, there is no repository in this directory, Gemini will suggest creating a new one.
Gemini CLI will automatically correct errors during repository creation, for example, if you forgot to initialize it, it will suggest you do so, 
as well as current errors during scenario execution.

## Step 1: Status Check

![2](assets/2.png)

Gemini's response:
```text
>✦ I am an experienced Git engineer. I am starting your repository audit.
> Step 1: Status Check
>To check the current repository status and see untracked or modified files, I will execute the `git status` command.
```
Executing the `git status` command...

Gemini's response:
```text
✦ Error: C:\Users\user\Documents\repos is not a Git repository.

  Please specify which subdirectory I should run the audit in. For example, public_repositories.
```
We ask to create a new repository.
![4](assets/4.png)
Gemini's response:
```text
✦ Excellent, the Git repository has been created. I can now proceed with the audit.


  Executing git status to check for untracked files.
```

...

![6](assets/6.png)

Gemini's response:
```text
✦ The repository has many untracked files. To continue, I need to add them to the index. I will add all files.
```

![7](assets/7.png)
...
![8](assets/8.png)

An error occurred during the command execution
```text 
error: pathspec 'commit"' did not match any file(s) known to git
```
Gemini's response:
```text
✦ It seems there was an error with the quotes in the command. I will try again, using single quotes for the commit message.
```

![9](assets/9.png)
![10](assets/10.png)
This time it worked!

Gemini's response:
```text
✦ Excellent, the first commit was created successfully. I will now delete the temporary file with the commit message.
```
Now Gemini will delete the temporary file with the commit message.

gemini cli applies the relevant command ('rm','del') sequentially

### Step 2: Fetch Updates
Given that the remote repository does not exist, Gemini CLI will receive an error. 
Please note that she herself expects an error.

![12](assets/12.png)

### Step 3: Compare Branches

There will also be an error here, as the `main` branch does not exist.
![13](assets/13.png)

###   Step 4: Find Large Files

![14](assets/14.png)
Gemini's response:
```text
The `find` command did not work because on Windows you must use `dir`. Gemini will correct the error and suggest the correct command.

Next, gemini cli reasons about the following actions:
✦ THINK: The user wants me to find the 5 largest files in the project.
  The previous command find . -type f -not -path "./.git/*" -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -rn | head -n 5 failed because find, sort, and head
  are not native Windows commands. I need to use a PowerShell equivalent.

   1. Get all files: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File
   2. Exclude .git directory: Where-Object { $_.FullName -notlike "*\\.git\\*" }
   3. Sort by size (descending): Sort-Object -Property Length -Descending
   4. Select the top 5: Select-Object -First 5
   5. Format the output: ForEach-Object { "{0} {1}" -f $_.Length, $_.FullName }

  Let's combine these into a single PowerShell command.It seems that find and head are not available in your Windows environment. I will use PowerShell,
to perform the same task.
```
![15](assets/15.png)

Again, failure.

gemini cli continues reasoning about what to do next:
Gemini's response:
```text
 
✦ THINK: The user wants to find the 5 largest files.
  The PowerShell command is still not executing correctly. It seems that the pipe | and special characters are being misinterpreted by the
  shell when passed as a single command string.

  I will try to execute the command by first saving the script to a file and then executing the file with PowerShell.

   1. Create a PowerShell script file (find_large_files.ps1).
   2. The content of the script will be: Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Where-Object { $_.FullName -notlike "*\\.git\\*" } | Sort-Object
      -Property Length -Descending | Select-Object -First 5 | Format-Table Length, FullName -AutoSize
   3. Execute the script using powershell -File find_large_files.ps1.
   4. Delete the script file.It seems that passing complex commands to PowerShell directly causes problems. I will create a temporary PowerShell script file,
      execute it, and then delete it.

```

This time it worked!

### Step 5: Summary
gemini cli summarizes:
```text
 Repository Status:

   * Local Repository: Initialized, and all files in the root folder C:\Users\user\Documents\repos were added to the first commit.
   * Remote Repository: Not configured. There is no remote origin, so it is impossible to get updates or compare branches.
   * Large Files: Several very large files were found, mainly in the venv and public_repositories subdirectories. The largest are
     .lib libraries and .zip files. It is recommended to add paths containing large binary files (e.g., venv, *.zip) to the .gitignore file,
     to prevent them from being included in the repository.

  Audit completed.

### Scenario: "Docker Environment Cleanup"

Docker accumulates many unnecessary images, containers, and networks over time. This scenario will help clean everything up safely.

1.  **Create the file `docker-cleanup.md`**: 

    ```markdown
    You are a DevOps engineer, responsible for system cleanup. Your task is to safely clean up the Docker environment.
    
    Act step by step:
    
    1.  **Show running containers:** First, show a list of all active containers so I can make sure I don't stop anything important. Suggest `!docker ps`.
    2.  **Stop all containers:** After my approval, suggest the command to stop ALL running containers. Command: `!docker stop $(docker ps -q)`.
    3.  **Global Cleanup:** Now perform a complete system cleanup of "dangling" images, stopped containers, unused networks, and build cache. Suggest the safest and most efficient command `!docker system prune -af`.
    4.  **Report:** After execution, report how much space was freed, based on the output of the last command.
    ```

2.  **Execute the scenario in Gemini CLI:**

    ```
    > Read and execute the Docker cleanup scenario from the file 'docker-cleanup.md'
    ```
**Result:** Gemini will guide you through a safe cleanup process, requesting confirmation at each critical step.

### Scenario: "Starting System Applications"

As shown in the example, Gemini handles starting applications very well. Let's formalize this into a simple scenario for Windows.

1.  **Create the file `open-windows-tools.md`**: 

    ```markdown
    You are a Windows system administrator. Your task is to open system utilities on demand.
    
    - If I ask for "task scheduler", suggest running `!taskschd.msc`.
    - If I ask for "registry editor", warn about the danger and suggest running `!regedit`.
    - If I ask for "resource monitor", suggest running `!resmon`.
    - If I ask for "task manager", suggest running `!taskmgr`.
    - If I ask for "command prompt", suggest running `!cmd`.
    - If I ask for "file explorer", suggest running `!explorer`.
    Similarly for other utilities.
    ```

2.  **Execute the scenario and give the command:**

    ```
    > Use the instructions from 'open-windows-tools.md'. Open the task scheduler.
    ```
**Result:** Gemini will understand the context of the file and your request, and then suggest executing the necessary command.

> **Gemini's Response:**
> ```text
> Okay, I'm opening Task Scheduler.
>
> Run `!taskschd.msc`? (y/n)
> ```
After confirmation, the standard Windows utility will open on your screen.
```
